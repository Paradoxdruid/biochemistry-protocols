# Biochemistry Protocols

This repository is a storage place for accessible versions of biochemistry, chemistry, and biological sciences protocols.  It will initially include protocols from the [Bonham Lab](https://bohamlab.com), but others are very welcome to submit pull requests to add additional protocols and methods.

## Motivation

One of the greatest strengths of the open source software movement is the ability for individuals worldwide to incrementally contribute to and improve upon software products, by creating an open, transparent, iterative, and accessible system for sharing source code, reporting errors, and submitting corrections and contributions.

As a biochemist and molecular biologist, I think this is a model that could greatly benefit the sharing and improvement of protocols, methods, and techniques in the chemical and biological sciences.  Publication of methods in articles, supporting information, and methodology books is useful, but is not inherently or easily revised and corrected by those who use and adopt the techniques.

This repository then, is a first-draft model of a system to adopt the principles of collaborative software engineering to support generation and curation of the best chemical & biological protocols and methods possible.

## Organization

Currently, protocols documents are divided into directories based on their molecular/chemical target.  This organization is likely to be revisited in the future, and a more formal organization system to be adopted.  Suggestions are welcome!

## Contributing

Contributions are very, very welcome.  For corrections, problem reports, troubleshooting requests, or other modifications to existing reports, please use the "Issues" feature of this repository.

New contributions please submit following the format specified in [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md)

## Citing

When possible, contributed Protocols should include a relevant citation reference; if none is given, you may cite this repository as follows:
