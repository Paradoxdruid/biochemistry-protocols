# Protocol Name (replace)

## Overview

### Description

> A brief, high-level description of the protocol; including goal or typical use case and other relevant details that might help a reader decide if this is a relevant and appropriate protocol for their use case.

### Citation

> (optional) Inclusion of an appropriate journal or other citation, in ACS, JBC, or other common reference format.  Typically, the journal article where this protocol was introduced and used; recognizing that protocols necessarily build iteratively on previous work.

### Version

> Version follows a loose version of [semver](https://semver.org/), where:
> 
> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
> 
> MAJOR version when you make major, incompatible protocol changes
> 
> MINOR version when you add new information or expansion to a protocol in a backwards compatible manner
> 
> PATCH version when you make backwards compatible corrections or bug-fixes

1.0.0

## Materials & Instrumentation

> This section should contain an unordered list of required reagents, materials, instrumentation, software, or other requirements needed for the protocol.  When possible, these should be written as generically as possible, rather than specifying a particular vendor or brand-name (except in cases where it is only available via one vendor, it is believed by the protocol author that only a given vendor has appropriate quality, other other circumstances that dictate a particular vendor).  A vendored version may be provided as an example to help guide the user.

> Explanatory text, briefly summarizes why a particular resource is needed, or helpful notes on obtaining or configuring resources, are acceptable and appreciated.  However, detailed set-up or preparation procedures should appear in [Procedure](#procedure), below.

> When useful, images may be included through link or direct embedding. Directly embedded images should be in `.png` format, saved in the same directory as the protocol file, preferably with a filename that relates to the protocol.

* Nanopure H<sub>2</sub>O
* Gel imaging station (Biorad Gel Doc or equivalent)
* Nucleotide intercalating stain (SYBR Green I or equivalent)

## Procedure

> This section should contain an ordered (numbered) list of procedural steps, including as much detail as possible to enable accurate reproduction of the technique.
> The steps may be interrupted with blockquote sections pointing out relevant information, such as particular hazards, common errors or troubleshooting, or other information that should be highlighted for the end-user.
> The procedure may be sub-divided into sub-sections for clarity, using third-level (`###`) heading indentation for sub-sections.

### Gel Preparation

1. Add 0.5 g of agarose to 50 mL of 0.5X TBE in a clean 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask, swirl to mix (agarose will not fully dissolve)
2. Carefully microwave mixture on high power for 20 second intervals, swirling between cycles, until mixture is fully dissolved and clear.

> **Caution:** Flask and solution will become very hot.  Always use a heat glove, wear googles or other protective eyewear, and stay cautious of hot liquids.

3. Carefully pour agarose solution into prepared gel mold.

### Running the gel

1. Set electrophoresis power supply to appropriate voltage for your sample (typically 80 - 120 V for common applications, see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for more advice).
2. Next step.

## Expected Results

> This section should contain details of anticipated or expected results.
> Images, linked or directly embedded, can be very helpful for this section.  Directly embedded images should be in `.png` format, saved in the same directory as the protocol file, preferably with a filename that relates to the protocol.

The imaged gel should have clear separation of bands, similar to this [example gel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/DNAgel4wiki.png) from Wikipedia.

## Troubleshooting

> (optional) This section is optional but encouraged, and includes notes and advice to guide optimization and troubleshooting of this protocol.

> Examples from experience are very valuable, both successful approaches and just an valuably, unsuccessful efforts, to avoid duplication of effort.

## References

> This section should include an ordered or unordered list of relevant references; these may include earlier journal articles that inspired or guided creation of this protocol, links to online resources or tools, links to other protocols, or other relevant information.

## Copyright

> This section should contain a statement explicitly releasing this protocol under the MIT license used in this repository.
